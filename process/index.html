                <h2>Inspiration</h2>
                <p>

                    I wanted my final website to reflect my love of drawing and journaling so I envisioned a virtual
                    sketchbook as my point of reference. I then started looking at other websites that inspired me with
                    their graphics, particularly, I drew inspiration from the Interactive Media Web page, Moonshine.mu
                    and last year's student Abha. There were elements in each of these pages that I enjoyed for various
                    reasons.

                <p>Font wise, I wanted something fun and approachable so I went with a font that was slightly rounded
                    but not too much otherwise I feared it might look dated. I ran into many challenges when trying to
                    iterate my design that by the end of the process I determined less is more with my concept hence why
                    I mainly utilized css and a small bit of javascript for the more in-depth interactions. </p>

                <h2>Final Ideations</h2>
                <p>In the end, I designed an interactive website where upon entering the user can draw on the screen any
                    image they want and then they can click on the side tabs that lead to the informative sections of
                    the website. The drawing canvas proved to be the most enjoyable element of my website as every time
                    I open that page, Iâ€™m driven to engage with it.
                </p>
                <p>Upon completion, I wished my design was more complex as I felt like the limitations of time and not
                    fully understanding what I could do with the code kept me from reaching my full potential. I felt
                    like this index challenged me to think outside of the box and find ways to insert knowledge that I
                    learned throughout this semester into my work.
