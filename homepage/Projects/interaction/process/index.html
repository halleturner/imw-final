                <h2>Initial process</h2>
                <p> For this assignment, I was given the scroll interaction to implement within my web page design. At
                    first, I found it challenging to think of a concept where the webpage would be interactive while
                    scrolling but once I saw examples of ways it was done in the past this informed my future decisions.
                    To start, I gathered various samples from webpages that Peter showed us in class as my inspiration
                    then I used Are.Na to store my potential ideas. I knew that I wanted to create something simple but
                    interactive so the easiest platform I could think to utilize for this was p5.js.

                </p>
                <p>During my first iteration, I was inspired by the capabilities of API databases and how recently many
                    social media platforms have begun to censor information from their users. I looked towards a
                    previous student's website and was planning to design a website that would funnel news information
                    onto the screen but as the user scrolls, the information becomes censored.</p>

                <h2>Second Round of Ideations</h2>
                <p> However, once I started playing around with p5.js, I discovered they have an abundance of
                    sound-based resources. This intrigued me more than my original idea so I looked into ways that my
                    idea could instead be centered around a fun audio interaction.
                </p>
                <p>In the end, I developed a website using the p5.js oscillator sound function. When users visit the
                    page they are greeted with a blank page that has a bar which is tethered to the cursor, as the user
                    scrolls down the frequency goes up in decibels and as they move their mouse left to right this
                    controls the volume.
