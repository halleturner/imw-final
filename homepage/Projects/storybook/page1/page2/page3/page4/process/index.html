                <p>
                    For this project, I was thinking about the ways in which I could tell a visual story through solely images. Initially, my ideas were very detailed and elaborate but upon completing my ideation sketches I decided that I wanted to tell a non-fiction educational story with basic shapes. 
                    My first concept was to look at the stages of an egg hatching while allowing the viewer to control the outcome but due to my limited knowledge of drawing with CSS I thought a butterfly might be easier for me to translate instead.

                I drew inspiration from the visuals in the childrens books, Creaturepedia by Adrienne Barman and The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle.

                <p>
                 Taking my references into account, I researched the different stages a butterfly transforms into during metamophasis and redrew my sketches in Figma.
