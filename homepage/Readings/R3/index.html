        <h1>1. Why does Laurel Schwulst advocate for individual websites over social media? Do you agree with her?
            Please
            explain your answer.</h1>
        <h2>Laurel Schwulst advocates for individual websites over social media as websites encourage the user to be
            creative with how they engage and interact with the medium. On the contrary, social media platforms are
            owned by private corporations that prioritize advertising as their main focus over user engagement and
            connection. Given their users’ happiness is not their primary focus, it’s considered acceptable for users to
            feel anxiety when using social media sites.</h2>
        <h1>2. In this article, Schwulst outlines several metaphors defining the behaviour of websites. Write a
            paragraph describing your own metaphor for a website. Put that text into its own simple website designed to
            extend that comparison. Upload it to your Github server and post the link here.</h1>
        <h2>A website behaves like the changing of seasons in Canada. From Winter to Summer and back again, as time
            passes so does the landscape outside. The weather is not always predictable but can be controlled or
            manipulated by factors beyond our control. During transitional seasons, we are met with complex weather
            patterns that range from hot to cold. A website is like the seasons in Canada as it’s never static but
            always dynamically evolving.</h2>
