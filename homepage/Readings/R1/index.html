        <h1>1. What is the thesis of this article?</h1>
        <h2>Despite technologies' ever-changing forms and evolution, the web we use today continues to exist in the
            medium
            in which it was created.</h2>


        <h1>2. Carpenter describes the handmade web as a form of resistance. In your own words, what is being resisted?
        </h1>
        <h2>The handmade web is a form of resistance as users partaking in this movement object to authoritarian ideals
            and
            autocracy. They strive to resist a centralized web where corporations control the internet and block
            individuality by removing the users from the process. Instead, those creating handmade websites wish to
            decentralize the internet by demystifying the tools so everyone can take part in it thus creating an
            accessible
            web.</h2>


        <h1>3. Reflecting on your own experiences, what are other examples of drawing attention the "physicality" of the
            web?
        </h1>
        <h2>Reflecting on my own experiences, platforms like shopify and wordpress sites draw attention to the
            physicality
            of the web because they allow business owners and writers the opportunity to learn about customizing their
            personal/business websites. In most cases, they get to be an active editor in what they want their shops to
            look
            like and how they want them to function. They are given the option of using a pre-made template or of doing
            the
            backend code themselves.</h2>
